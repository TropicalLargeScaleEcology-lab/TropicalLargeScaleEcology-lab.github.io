### Carla Restrepo, Principal Investigator
<p> Contact: cresre@hpcf.upr.edu </p>

Carla did her M.Sc. and Ph.D. (1995) in Zoology at the University of Florida. She did her postdoctoral research at the University of New Mexico. 
Now, she is working at the University of Puerto Rico where she has been researching various topics, all related to landscape ecology.  

## Lab members
### Yakshi Ortiz-Maldonado, Research Assistant

<p>Contact: yakshi.ortiz@upr.edu </p>

[Yakshi](https://yakshiupr.github.io "Yakshi's personal page") did her BS and her MSc. at the University of Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras. Her thesis focused understanding the role of microorganisms associated to roots, rhizobiomes, in the weathering of silicate rocks at the tropics. The weathering of these rocks, especially when they have high concentrations of Calcium and Magnesium is known to affect the short- and the long Carbon cycles. Now, she continues working at TLSE-lab analyzing rock samples incubated 4 years to continue characterizing microbial communities involved in rock weathering.

<p> Contact: francisco.diaz17@upr.edu </p>
Francisco is currently in his 4th year on Biology at the University of Puerto Rico. He has been working for the last three years at the TLSE-lab. He started as a volunteer, became fascinated and continued here with us. In the lab, his research is focused on characterizing tree growth patterns through dendrochronology using tree cores to ultimately  infer climate conditions that led to those growing patterns.


### Rachel Cruz-PÃ©rez, Undegrad Student

<p> Contact: rachel.cruz@upr.edu </p>
Rachel is currently in her last year on a dual B.S. in Environmental Sciences and Biology at the University of Puerto Rico. She has been working at TLSE-lab for the last one and a half year. Her research is focused on how biotic and abiotic factors influence plant functional traits, namely root tensile strength. Towards this end, she is compiling the first global root tensile strength database, which will help strengthen our knowledge of belowground interactions and its effects on ecosystem processes.


### Alanis Rosa Santiago, Undergrad Student
<img src='/images/landslide.jpg' width="300" align="right">
<p> Contact: alanis.rosa1@upr.edu </p>
Alanis is currently at her XX year on Biology at the University of Puerto Rico. She has been working for the last one and a half year at TLSE-lab. Her research is focused on characterizing the functional diversity of plant communities developing on landslides. Her research interests include studying the influence of the environmet and disturbances on plant communities.

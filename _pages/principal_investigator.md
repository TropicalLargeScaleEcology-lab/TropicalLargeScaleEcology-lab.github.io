## Research Interests

My research interests are diverse, reflecting to some extent my fascination for the enormous diversity of tropical ecosystems, the complexity of these landscapes, and the processes that modify them. Yet, the simplicity underlying this diversity and complexity has contributed in profound ways to my diversification, as reflected by the approaches that I have taken to address questions about the organization of ecosystems. I combine quantitative methods, satellite imagery, GIS, non-spatial and spatial data coming from multiple sources, and field work to examine processes that modify the spatial structure of tropical landscapes, and the consequences of this heterogeneity on ecosystem attributes. My keen interest in conservation issues is reflected throughout most of my work.

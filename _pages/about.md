Welcome to the Tropical Large-Scale Ecology Lab (TLSELab) at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras. Tropical landscapes are complex, and we are interested in understanding the origin of this complexity, as well as its consequences for the diversity and functioning of ecosystems. We explicitly recognize the role of space in the organization of ecosytems whether at local or regional scales, and the possibility for interactions between them largely facilitaded by the increasing influence of humans on landscpes.

Our main goals are to:

Contribute to the theoretical foundations of the field of Landscape Ecology and Macroecology.

Contribute tools and techniques for the study of landscapes, ecosytem processes, and plant and animal assemblages at large scales.
Apply this knowledge to the conservation, management, and restoration of tropical landscapes.

## Prospective Graduate Students
We are always looking for enthusiastic, responsible, and hard-working students willing to learn and incorporate a spatial component into their projects. Learning can be achieved in different ways and we expect students to not conform with what they receive in the classroom. We expect students to be avid readers, participate in the lab meetings and departmental seminars, and engage in research while thinking how to transmit their knowledge to broader audiences.

Students applying to our Graduate Program receive support through Teaching Assistanthips. UPR-RP offers a limited number of fellowships to students making progress in their studies. We encourage and help prospective students as well as students working already with us to apply for fellowships and grants. If you are interested in applying to our program and working with us, we will be more than happy to guide you through this process. Always remember that writing takes time and therefore considerable planning to meet deadlines.
